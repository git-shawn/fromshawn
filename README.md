# fromshawndev

`fromshawndev` is my personal portfolio website built with Next.JS for use on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Inside you'll find my resume, a contact form, and information regarding my apps.

Feel free to poke around the code and steal any code that you like.

Since it was developed for personal use, this repository is largely undocumented. However, if you have any questions regarding aspects of the project feel free to submit an issue using the `question` label. I'd be happy to answer.

## Running in Development

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
