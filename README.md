# fromshawn

`fromshawn` is my personal portfolio website built with Next.JS for use on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Inside you'll primarily find information regarding my apps.

Feel free to poke around and steal any code that you like.

Since it was developed for personal use, this repository is largely undocumented. However, if you have any questions regarding aspects of the project feel free to submit an issue using the `question` label. I'd be more than happy to lend a hand.
