##3 Do I have to use iCloud?

No. Size limitations on the Apple Watch make generating QR codes impractical.

### My QR codes look different on Apple Watch.
QR codes are automatically simplified to improve scannability on Apple Watch. While your color choices may remain, any shapes or image overlays won't.

### My QR code won't scan on Apple Watch.
While QR Pop does attempt to automatically improve the scannability of your code, highly complex QR codes may not be scannable at small scales. To improve your chances, consider selecting "Brighten Code" to simplify your design to just black-and-white.
