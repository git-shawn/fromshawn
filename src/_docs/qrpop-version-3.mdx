- Images can now easily be imported from either Photos or Files.

### Archive
- A brand new "Archive" has been added to QR Pop.
- QR codes created in the builder or duplicated via the scanner can now be added to the Archive.
- Codes saved to the Archive are automatically saved to iCloud when available.

### Widgets
- Widgets are now available for the lockscreen on iOS and generally on macOS.

### Apple Watch
